NAU CS305 Module 05 Submission Repository for Section 001 Spring 2023



This is a repository for a simple web-based game I am creating for CS212.
The project involves dynamically generating a table of white squares in HTML using Javascript, and choosing a random number between 1-10 inclusive of squares to change to black as the starting configuration of the game.
This game is a replication of "Lights Out", where the goal is to cause all 25 squares in the 5x5 grid to change to white by clicking squares, which causes them to flip their state - as well as those of adjacent squares - from black to white or vice versa.

TODO: Find a way to target a particular square with an onclick event listener, with getElementById or some other method
TODO: Edit clickSquare function to properly change state of the clicked square and adjacent squares while remaining within the bounds of the table
TODO: Verify win condition check is working properly
TODO: Declare a set of solveable puzzles? Not sure if this is required for the assignment.
